## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

it was a fun challenge and quite ease at first, until I hit a wal with the plan section, flex wasn't working for me just right, it kept misbehaving.

that's why I opted for the position syntax, please send me any feedback you can on how I could inprove, thank you everyone!


### Continued development

I would like to learn deeply flexbox and grid, as well as inprove on the format of my syntax, sorry if it's too messy!


## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank a fellow web developer student, Guilherme Pereira Pinto (github username: dz03vc), for providing the challenge!
